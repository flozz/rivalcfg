Welcome to rivalcfg's documentation!
====================================

Rivalcfg is a **Python library** and a **CLI utility program** that allows you
to configure SteelSeries gaming mice on Linux and Windows (probably works on
BSD and Mac OS too, but not tested).

I first created this program to configure my Rival 100 and the original Rival
mice, then I added support for other Rival devices thanks to contributors.
Today this project aims to support any SteelSeries gaming mice (Rival,
Sensei,...).

.. NOTE::

   This is an unofficial software. It was made by reverse engineering
   devices and is not supported nor approved by SteelSeries.
