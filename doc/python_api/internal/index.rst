Internal Python API
===================

Rivalcfg internal API contains documentation for every functions and classes
implemented in this package. It is only useful to you if you want to hack into
rivalcfg itself, or if you want to know how it works... If you only want to
interact with SteelSeries mice from your own scripts, read the
:doc:`../high_level/index` documentation instead.
