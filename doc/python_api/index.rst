Python API
==========

**Rivalcfg** provides a complete **Python API** to configure **SteelSeries
gaming mice**. To make things simpler, the Python API documentation have been
splitted in half:

* the **high level API**: it is the one you want to use to interact with any supported
  mouse from your own scripts,

* the **internal API**: probably only useful to you if you want to develop
  rivalcfg itself.
